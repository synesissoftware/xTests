xTests - README
===============

Updated:    12th October 2019



xTests is a testing library for C and C++. Specifically, it is a small,
lightweight, portable, simple unit- and component-test framework suitable
for exercising C and C++ libraries. Its primary design features are:

- Portability. It relies on no platform-specific or compiler-specific
constructs. The only library it relies on is the 100% header-only,
open-source STLSoft library. It works with a large number of C/C++
compilers. Importantly, it is sufficiently simple and lightweight that it
is bundled with several other open-source libraries, and is an integral
part of their automated unit- and component-testing in their builds.
- Simplicity. It doesn't require pre-processing of your source code by
scripting languages. It doesn't use macros to create secret classes that
use Schwarz counters to register test cases. It relies on you to simply
code what you want, and nothing that you don't want.

xTests is completely free and includes source released under a BSD-style
license.
