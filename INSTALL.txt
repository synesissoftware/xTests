xTests - Install
================

Updated:    22nd July 2016


The following steps are required to install xTests:

    1. Download the latest distribution of xTests, from
       http://xtests.org/

    2. Unzip it to a directory of your choice, e.g ~/3pty/xtests-0.18.9

    3. Define an environment variable XTESTS_C_ROOT, whose
       value is the directory in which you unzipped
       it, e.g. XTESTS_C_ROOT=~/3pty/xtests-0.18.9

    4. Download the latest distribution of STLSoft, from http://stlsoft.org/

    5. Unzip it to a directory of your choice, e.g ~/3pty/stlsoft-1.9.128

    6. Define an environment variable STLSOFT, whose value is the directory
       in which you unzipped it, e.g. STLSOFT=~/3pty/stlsoft-1.9.128

    7. Open a command shell in the appropriate directory that matches your
       compiler:
       
       * if you're compiling with Visual C++ 7.1 then cd to build/vc71
       * if you're compiling for UNIX with GCC 4.2, then cd
         to build/gcc42.unix
       * if you're compiling for Win-x64 with Visual C++ 9, then cd
         to build/vc9.x64

    8. Build using make:

       * to build the xTests core libraries: "make build.libs.core"
       * to build all libraries, examples and test: "make build"
       * to build and run unit/component tests: "make test"
       * to build and run performance tests: "make test.performance"

NOTE: xTests depends on the (header-only) STLSoft libraries - version
  1.9.128 or later - available from http://www.stlsoft.org/.
